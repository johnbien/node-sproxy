This is a little app I put together to help in some testing of socket communications.

The idea is that multiple socket proxies can be started and managed remotely and on the fly. This can be usefull for testing communication failures, etc. 
Another use is in monitoring the traffic (although this can also be done with a tool like ngrep).

I'm keeping it here on github as a permenant plce for it to live, and thought others may find it useful.

It is work-in-progress and may be buggy. Little attention has been paid to fault tollerance and error handeliing.
