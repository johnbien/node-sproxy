This is a little app I put together to help in some testing of socket communications.

The idea is that multiple socket proxies can be started and managed remotely and on the fly. This can be usefull for testing communication failures, etc. 
Another use is in monitoring the traffic (although this can also be done with a tool like ngrep).

I'm keeping it here on github as a permenant plce for it to live, and thought others may find it useful.

It is work-in-progress and may be buggy. Little attention has been paid to fault tollerance and error handeliing.


to run the server, issue the command :

    node httpMsgHandler.js
    
This will start the server on port 10102

From a browser navigate to:

    http://localhost:10102

This will provide a page documenting the server.

COMMANDS:

 HELP - This will list all the available commands.

 ADDPROXY - Use this command to add a proxy on a port to a specified destination.
    Requires the MESSAGE parameter:
      MESSAGE - has two forms
        MESSAGE=<srcport>,<dstaddr>,<dstport> 
                or
        MESSAGE=<srcaddr>,<srcport>,<dstaddr>,<dstport>
        
 RMPROXY - Use this command to remove a proxy by giving the source port provided to ADDPROXY
